# Experiments in a programming language compiler in Rust

Name reflects the inspiration, BLS Pascal which packages a runtime,
editor, and compiler for largely complete Pascal in 12 KiB of Z80
machine code.

I'd like to do the same one day but not for Pascal, but ideally a
minimalistic functional programming language.

However first, how do we write parsers in Rust?
